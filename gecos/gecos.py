    """GECOS

    In the file /etc/passwd there is the so called GECOS field (which stands
    for "General Electric Comprehensive Operating System"), that is:

    username:password:userid:groupid:GECOS:home-dir:shell

    Where GECOS is divided as:

    FullName,RoomAddress,WorkPhone,HomePhone,Others

    ...where others are divided in as many commas as you like:

    FullName,RoomAddress,WorkPhone,HomePhone,Other1,Other2,Other3

    The typical format for the GECOS field is a comma-delimited list with this
    order:

    - User's full name (or application name, if the account is for a program)
    - Building and room number or contact person
    - Office telephone number
    - Home telephone number
    - Any other contact information (pager number, fax, external e-mail
    address, etc.)
